There are 2 types of memories as 

1) STACK

2) HEAP 

Value types will be stored in STACK memory, and reference types will be stored in HEAP memory. 

Boxing and Unboxing : 
______________________

The process of converting value types to reference type known as boxing, and reference type to value type
known as unboxing. 

Object is type, that which can be used for boxing and unboxing. 

int x;

x="Hello";
x=12;
x=12.5;

Object x;

x="Hello";
x=12;
x=12.5;

Once in object format, we cannot perform any operations, then we need to unbox 
and then only we can perform the operations. 

Method Overloading : 

The concept of using the same method name w.r.t Different data types or different 
parameters known as method overloading. 

Here, the method name must be same, but no.of parameters or type of parameters we 
are passing are different. 

class Demo {
   int a,b;
   a=5;
   b=8;
}

Why code will not compile is a class cannot contains code directly,
as assignmenet statements must be in method not in class. 

Then, how to give default values, then we need the help of constructors. 

A constructor is a special member, which used to initilize the member variables of the class
It is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 
________

   -> It will not contains any return type.
   -> It will not return any value. 
   -> It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. 
   -> A constructor can be overloaded. 


toString() : This method will be called automatically once you print the object. 

As you print the object, the code which is there in toString() will be executed.
