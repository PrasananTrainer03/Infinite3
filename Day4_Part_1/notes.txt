How to implement custom exceptions. 

You can create Custom Exceptions by using Exception class. Any class that which derived from Exception class can be treated as Custom Exception. 

System exceptions are inadequate to handle in all situations, then we need the help of custom exceptions. 

Write a program as sum of 2 numbers 

	if any number < 0 then throw NegativeException

	if anu number = 0 then throw NumbeZeroException

	else print sum. 

Write program to accept an email and check its valid email or not

Scanner class : Its from util package, which allows you to read data from the keyboard. 

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

next() -> used to read one word from keyboard.
nextLine() -> used to read a sentence
nextInt() -> used to read numbers
nextDouble() -> Used to read double value. 

Collections : 
_______________

What is the major drawback with arrays 

Arrays are static data structures, as once they are assigned we cannot change the 
size at runtime. This problem we need to overcome, then we need the help of 
Collections. 

Collections used to store data w.r.t. Object format, and they can grow to any size. 

If you want to add the elements, irrespective of size then we need the help of 
collections. 

Collections are falling from util package. 

There are 3 top level interfaces we have in collections known as 

List Interface : This interface extends the collection to handle sequence or a list of objects. Elements can be inserted in a list and can be accessed from a list using their index pos. in the list. 

ArrayList and LinkedList are falling under List interface. 



Set interface : This interface extends the Collection interface to handle sets containing unique elements.  This interface does not allow any duplicate elements in a set. 

	HashSet and LinkedHashSet are falling under Set interface. 

HashSet allows you to display values w.r.t. Random order, where 

LinkedHashSet used to display values w.r.t. Insertion Order. 

Wrapper classes : These are called primitive data type classes. 

int is value type, where Integer is the wrapper class. 




SortedSet interface : Used to extends the Set interface to handle the sorted sets. The elements of a set are ordered in ascending order in a sorted set.  TreeSet is falling under SortedSet
