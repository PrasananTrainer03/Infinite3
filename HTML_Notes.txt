Web Applications : 
____________________

These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

(i) Scripting Languages

	These are the languages, that which are interpreted, during runtime they takes lot of time to execute.

(ii) Programming Languages 

	These are the langauges,that which are compiled first, during runtime they takes very less time to 
		execute. 

In Web Applications, we can implement 

	(i) Client-Side 

		Enables you to access the application from client. 

		No Network traffic

		Execution will be faster.

	(ii) Server-Side 

		Enables you to access the application from server

		Network traffic is high

		A bit slower.

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. Min. security, plesae opt for client-side
scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. security, please opt for both
client-side/server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High Security, please opt for 
server-side scripting ***
