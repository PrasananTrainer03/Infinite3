There are 2 types of memories as 

1) STACK

2) HEAP 

Value types will be stored in STACK memory, and reference types will be stored in HEAP memory. 

Boxing and Unboxing : 
______________________

The process of converting value types to reference type known as boxing, and reference type to value type
known as unboxing. 

Object is type, that which can be used for boxing and unboxing. 

int x;

x="Hello";
x=12;
x=12.5;

Object x;

x="Hello";
x=12;
x=12.5;

Once in object format, we cannot perform any operations, then we need to unbox 
and then only we can perform the operations. 

Method Overloading : 

The concept of using the same method name w.r.t Different data types or different 
parameters known as method overloading. 

Here, the method name must be same, but no.of parameters or type of parameters we 
are passing are different. 

class Demo {
   int a,b;
   a=5;
   b=8;
}

Why code will not compile is a class cannot contains code directly,
as assignmenet statements must be in method not in class. 

Then, how to give default values, then we need the help of constructors. 

A constructor is a special member, which used to initilize the member variables of the class
It is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 
________

   -> It will not contains any return type.
   -> It will not return any value. 
   -> It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. 
   -> A constructor can be overloaded. 


toString() : This method will be called automatically once you print the object. 

As you print the object, the code which is there in toString() will be executed. 

static variable :

These are the variables that which retains values irrespective of type of object. 

these are called class variables. 

In java, if you find the keyword static, please ensure it belongs to class. 

static constructor : 
____________________

These are the constructors, that which are to be called before control reaches the 
entrypoint. These constructors will not be overloaded. 
These constructors are used to initilize the static variables of the class. 
In java, we don't have any static constructor, only static { } will act as static constructor.

static methods : 

These are the methods, that which are to be called by using class_name. 

No Object required to call these methods. 

Inheritance : 

The concept of deriving a new class from already existing class known as inheritance,
the class which derived known as derived class, the class from which its derived
known as base class. 

Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

class First {
...
...
}

class Second extends First {
....
....
....
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all 

public/protected and friendly members of base class. 

super : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need 
the help of super keyword. 

It has 2 forms as 

	(i) super as a keyword

	(ii) super as a constructor 

		If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, 
		then we need the help of super constructor.
