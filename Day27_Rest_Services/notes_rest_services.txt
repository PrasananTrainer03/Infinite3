Webservices : 
______________

Contains webmethods, that can be called across various programming languages. 

If you want to make any method as write once and call from any programming language, then we need the help
of webservice. 

There are 2 types of webservices as

1) SOAP Based

	These are used to deal data using xml standards. 

	It has various standards as 

	(i) SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol 

		it is a communication protocol, that which enables the communcation between webservice 
		 and client. 

	(ii) UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) 

		It is a place where we can register and deploy the webservices. 

	(iii) WSDL (Webservice Description Language) 

		It generates xml vocoblury for web methods which are there in service. 


SOAP based services are outdated, because every time, they pass the data w.r.t. xml format
but, all the time xml format processing will not be possible. Then, we need the help of
REST based services.

2) REST Based 

      Representational State Transfer 

	These are services, that which allows you process data in various formats as

		(i) Plain Text 
		(ii) Html
		(iii) XML
		(iv) JSON 
		etc... various formats we can process. 

Rest services are very fast, as they work purely w.r.t. Annotation based. 

REST Services have 4 http verbs as 

GET

@GET -> Used when you need to retreive any resources from server. 

POST  -> Used for INSERT operation

@POST

PUT -> Used for insert/update operation.

@PUT

DELETE -> Used for Delete Operation

@DELETE 

@Path annotation gives alias name to method and as well as for class. 

@Produces
The
@Produces annotation is used to specify the MIME media types of
representations a resource can produce and send back to the client: for
example,example,"text/ (Multi-purpose internet mail Extension)
